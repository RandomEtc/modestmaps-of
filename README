Tiled map library for OpenFrameworks, for displaying maps from OpenStreetMap, CloudMade, Bing, etc.

Work in progress! Please test :)

Missing features:
 * mousewheel support (must I patch glut? really?)
 * examples with overlays
 * packaging into a library
 * error handling
 * more tile providers
 * better display of copyright etc.
 * intelligent use of HTTP

Feedback, critique, patches welcome!
